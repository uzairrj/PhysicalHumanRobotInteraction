# Physical Human Robot Interaction
Teleoperation refers to the remote control of a robot by a human operator, allowing the operator to perform tasks in environments that may be dangerous or inaccessible to humans. The literature provides a detailed analysis of various teleoperation architectures, including Four-Channel Bilateral Teleoperation, Two-Channel Teleoperation, and Three-Channel Position-Force and Position (PF-P) teleoperation. These architectures are designed to enable effective communication between a human operator and a robot, allowing the operator to control the robotâ€™s movements and actions. The article also discusses the use of Kalman Filter/Predictor and Kalman Smoother in teleoperation. The torque of the motor is predicted using the linear regression. These techniques are used to improve the accuracy of position, velocity, and force estimation in teleoperation systems. The tank-based and scattering wave-based architecture is used to eliminate the significance delays in the communication channel. This literature provides valuable insights into the field of Physical Human Robot Interaction and its applications in teleoperation.
