Simulink - identification of a DC motor

Please find attached the Simulink model of a DC motor controlled in position with a simple proportional gain (please refer to the supp materials for the equations of DC motors and for PID controllers).

For the HW, students should:

- run the model to save time series for voltages (input) and noisy position measurements (output);

- estimate velocities and accelerations from noisy positions (and compare them with the 'real' ones);

- identify a first-order system from voltage (voltages "plays the role" of torques \tau in the slide) to velocity even though the 'real' system is described by a  second-order ODE;

- check the importance of the inductance L in the above approximation.
